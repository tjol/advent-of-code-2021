ADVENT OF CODE 2021

https://adventofcode.com/2021

Solved using a bunch of different languages, depending on what I feel like
using for the problem on the day. How to build and run the solutions depends
on the language.

Each solution takes the input on standard input and produces the solution
on standard output.

Let's see how far I get!

Languages used

 Day  1  -  Python, Befunge-98
 Day  2  -  Rust, Befunge-98
 Day  3  -  C
