ADVENT OF CODE 2021

https://adventofcode.com/2021

Solved using a bunch of different languages, depending on what I feel like
using for the problem on the day.

Each solution takes the input on standard input and produces the solution
on standard output. The script run-all.zsh compiles, runs and benchmarks all
solutions.

Let's see how far I get!
